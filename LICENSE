This Addendum to the Dolby Voice Software and Support Agreement (“Addendum”) is entered into by and
between Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation, a New York corporation, Dolby International AB, a
Swedish company residing in The Netherlands and you (as an individual hereinafter referred to as “you”
or “Customer” or "Licensee"). This Addendum is governed by the terms in the Dolby Voice Software and
Support Agreement entered into by and between the parties, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Defined terms used in this Addendum, and not otherwise defined herein, have the meanings given
to them in the Agreement. In consideration of the mutual covenants herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. License: Pursuant to this Addendum, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a royalty-free, nonexclusive,
nontransferable, nonassignable license (subject to Licensee’s continued compliance with this Addendum)
for the duration of the Term, to Sell the software product(s) set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, in
machine executable object code form, and any supporting documentation provided by Licensor to Licensee
(collectively, the “Software”) to End Users for use in Consumer Electronics Devices solely as connected to
the Dolby Voice Conferencing Server Software through use of the Licensee Services in the United States and
Canada only.

2. EULA: Licensee shall incorporate the End User License Agreement (set out in Exhibit B titled “EULA”) with
the Licensee Service to govern End User’s use of the Software. For the avoidance of doubt, the EULA set out
in this Addendum shall supersede the EULA referenced in the Agreement.

3. License Restriction: Licensee shall have no right to copy (except for one (1) back-up copy), modify or
create derivative works of the Software or to reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise
attempt to derive source code from the Software.

4. Rights in Software: This Agreement is not a sale and does not transfer to Licensee any title or ownership
interest in or to the Software or any patent, copyright, trade secret, trade name, trademark or other
proprietary or intellectual property rights related to the Software. Except for the rights expressly granted
herein, Licensor retains all of its right, title and interest in and to the Software. Licensee shall not remove,
alter, or obscure any proprietary notices contained on or within the Software and shall reproduce such
notices on any back-up copy of the Software.

5. Open Source Software: “Open Source Software” means any software or other material included in the
Software which is (1) subject to a license (a) listed at http://opensource.org/licenses/ as of the effective date,
(b) that meet the criteria listed at http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php as of the effective date, or (c)
that is licensed under a free software, open source software, or similar licensing model; and (2) which if
distributed by Licensee would (a) impose any obligations on Licensee to provide reports or royalties, or to
disclose any information to a third party, or (b) impose any requirements that any patents related to the
Software must be licensed to, or may be asserted against, recipients of the Software. A list of such Open
Source Software, as amended from time to time, is specified in Exhibit C titled “Dolby Voice Electron
Framework SDK version 1.0 Third-Party Software. Open Source Software also includes libraries from the
FFmpeg project under the LGPLv2.1. The Open Source Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of
this Addendum. Instead, each item of Open Source Software is licensed under the terms of the end user
license that accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in this Addendum limits Licensee’s rights
under, or grants Licensee rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license
for the Open Source Software.

6. Feedback: Licensee hereby grants to Licensor a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual,
irrevocable, non-terminable, transferable, assignable and sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute,
publicly perform and display, make, have made, sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on,
and otherwise use and exploit any and all suggestions, comments, ideas, and all other types of information
relating to the Software which is communicated directly or indirectly by Licensee to Licensor.

7. Support: Licensor will provide technical support only for the version of Electron, Chromium and Dolby
Voice Client as listed in the release notes for the Software, and as updated from time to time by Licensor.

8. No Warranty by Licensor: LICENSOR IS PROVIDING THE SOFTWARE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO
LICENSEE “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED BY LICENSOR AND EXCLUDED. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SOFTWARE
AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE OR THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED THEREIN WILL MEET LICENSEE’S
REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
WILL BE CORRECTED. LICENSEE IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OPEN
SOURCE SOFTWARE AND ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO
THE FFMPEG OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE LICENSE.

9. Indemnification: Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, its affiliates, their
respective successors and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives for any
claim, liability, loss or damage arising out of: (a) Licensee’s breach of any term of this Agreement; and (b)
any claim of allegedly unauthorized use or violation of any third-party patent, copyright, trade secret, or
other intellectual property.

10. Precedence: In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the body of the Agreement and this
Addendum with respect to the Software listed in Exhibit A, this Addendum shall prevail.

11. This Addendum may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which, taken together shall constitute one and the same Addendum. Execution of a facsimile or electronic
copy of this Addendum shall have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or
